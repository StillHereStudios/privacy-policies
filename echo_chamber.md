## Echo Chamber: Privacy policy

Welcome to the privacy policy for Echo Chamber, a simple game inspired by some of the mobile games I played in my childhood (Flappy Bird, Don't Touch the Spikes, etc.).
I sincerely hope you enjoy playing it and don't find it too frustrating.
The game shouldn't require any permissions as far as I know, so just have fun!
